## Unreleased

- Retained sampling prepares required models through Core before reserving
  finite scratch headroom. Sufficient memory preserves unrelated resident
  models; pressure uses Core's eviction policy while protecting prepared models
  and their patch backings. The existing automatic 10 GiB scratch allowance is
  shared with admission and added to Core's sampling estimate.
- Preparation and admission receipts report separate timings, the finite memory
  target, available memory, protected models and full unloads. Partial unloads
  remain under Core's control.
